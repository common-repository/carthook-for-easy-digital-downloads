CartHook helps you increase revenue by automatically recovering abandoned carts.


== Description ==

CartHook for Easy Digital Downloads is the easiest and most effective way to recover abandoned carts for your EDD site.

The plugin makes integration between the Easy Digital Downloads platform and the CartHook web app super-simple, requiring only a copy/paste of your CartHook ID to be fully integrated in seconds.

Once installed and activated, CartHook will track visitors to your EDD checkout page. It will:

1. Capture the email address of every visitor to the checkout page as soon as it's typed into the email field.
2. If the purchase is not completed, it will trigger an automated email campaign designed to bring the visitor back to your site to finish buying.
3. Will help you automatically recover 15% to 20% of your abandoned carts, resulting in more revenue immediately.

Get started with a free 30-day trial at https://carthook.com/ - then download the plugin to easily integrate with your EDD site.
